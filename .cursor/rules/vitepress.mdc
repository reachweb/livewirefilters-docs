I have some docs in statamic that I want you to help me create to vite press. I will give you parts in Statamic md files and I want you to create the revelant pages

don't include any images I will do it myself later

convert Statamic's bard to md code.

use ```antlers for code unless you can understand it to be something else.

the docs location is on the project root and not ./docs

correct any huge grammar errors you find but otherwise don't change the text at all

add an h1 title in each page same with the page's title
