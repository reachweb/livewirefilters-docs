# Support & Pricing

## Who am I

Hello! I'm Iosif, a web developer and designer hailing from Kos, Greece. I founded Reach Web agency in 2012 and I've worked with many coders & designers since. With 20 years in the industry, I've journeyed through various technologies, from Wordpress & Joomla to discovering the rad path of web creation. Yes, I'm talking about Statamic!

I'm an official Statamic partner since 2023. My expertise extends to Laravel and Vue.js, while I enjoy designing things using Figma, Photoshop & Illustrator.

## Support

Statamic Livewire Filters is provided "as-is." While I am eager to help, my limited free time means I can't always address issues immediately.

If you need assistance:

- **Open an Issue:** Visit the Github repository and [open an issue](https://github.com/reachweb/statamic-livewire-filters/issues).
- **Email Us:** Reach out at info@reach.gr (see what I did there?) for support inquiries.

## Paid support

Need more dedicated help with this addon or anything related to Statamic, Laravel, or Livewire? I'm here to assist. Email me for an estimate. Operating a registered EU business, I can provide invoicing for any services rendered. Please note, due to high demand from other clients, paid support availability is not guaranteed.

## Pricing

Statamic Livewire Filters is not free. Considering the time it can potentially save you, I feel that [a small fee](https://statamic.com/addons/reach/statamic-livewire-filters) is justified. However, if you're unable to afford this fee or are using the addon in a non-profit or open-source project, please get in touch.
